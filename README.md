To get a better understanding of different deep learning architectures, my classmaters and I transformed real-life images of landscapes and buildings to Monet-Style images using DCGAN and CycleGAN models. 

This idea originated from the Kaggle competition: "I'm somewhat of a painter myself"

We also made a report called MonetReport.pdf to display our research, models, and results.
